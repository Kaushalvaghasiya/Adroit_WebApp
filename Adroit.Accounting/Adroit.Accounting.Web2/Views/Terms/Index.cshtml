The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account. If your organization account is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for your organization.

                                    3. ensuring that all activities that occur in connection with your organization account comply with this Agreement. You understand that ADROIT is not responsible for account administration and internal management of the Services for you.<br />
                                    <br />You are responsible for taking necessary steps for ensuring that your organization does not lose control of the administrator accounts. You may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email to adroitibsjnd@gmail.com, provided that the process is acceptable to ADROIT. In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, ADROIT may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to ADROIT demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold ADROIT liable for the consequences of any action taken by ADROIT in good faith in this regard.<br />

In the event of such termination, all data associated with such user account will be deleted. We will not provide you prior notice of such termination and option to back-up your data.

Each Service will be considered an independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not sufficient to keep your user account in another Service active. In case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be considered inactive.</p>

We may migrate your account or require you to migrate your account to a different cloud facility in the event of any updates to the region/country to cloud facility mapping at any point of time. You must not mask your internet protocol (IP) address at the time of sign-up since your region/country is determined base on your IP address. If, at any time, your actual region/country is found to be different from the region/country in our records, ADROIT may take appropriate action such as migrate your account or require you to migrate your account to the cloud facility corresponding to your region/country, or close your account and deny the Service to you. If you are served from a cloud facility outside your region/country and a ADROIT group entity has an office in your region/country, apart from storing the data in the cloud facility assigned to you, we may store a local copy of the data in your region/country.</p>
